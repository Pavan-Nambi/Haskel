# Haskel

Commands that starts with `:` are ghci commands not haskel commands

```
    :load <file> # load file
    :reload # reload file
    :type <expression> # get type of expression
    :quit # quit ghci
    :tail "hello" # get tail of string

```

if you see a error msg with `it` in it ,`it` is the default variable name haskel uses

ghci>9 `div` 2 (does int division)
4
